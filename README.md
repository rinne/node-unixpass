In A Nutshell
=============

This is a native javascript implementation of Unix/Linux compatible
password hashing. The currently implemented variants include
legacy-DES (13 characters [./0-9A-Za-z]), extended-DES (underscore
followed by 19 characters) MD5 ($1$), SHA256 ($5$), and SHA512 ($6$).

The ones missing are
  - Blowfish hashing ($2$, $2a$, $2b$, $2x$, $2y$)

Should some brave soul implement any or all of above, they will be accepted.

Usage
=====

```
const up = require('unixpass');

// Returns password hash using SHA256
up.crypt('mypassword', '$5$saltsaltmoresalt');

// Returns a password hash with autogenerated salt using SHA512
up.mkpass('mypassword');

// Returns true if password matches hash, false otherwise
up.check('mypassword', '$1$saltsalt$dfhjlwheucnsdicbnwuibnwicb');

```

Caution!
========

Be aware that legacy-DES only cares about first 8 characters of the
password. While no new passwords should be encrypted using that, it
may be useful in validating some old stuff. Also, it is an interesting
piece of history that deserves to be reimplemented also in js.
